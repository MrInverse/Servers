Turn me from a cat into a dog
Now I want you to take me on a walk
Watch me be the loyalest of all
Okay baby here's the leash, purr, purr, purr
I don't wanna be just friends
It's no coincidence, it's a kitty-incidence
They be testing out your patience but I'm here for it
Girl, I promise (girl, I promise)
So get used to it, ain't no stopping
Me when you walk in
Got me acting up all crazy, lemme be your pet
Baby make a lil' room, let me get next to ya
I was messin' (I was messin')
Now I'm thankin' ya
I learned my lesson (purr, purr)
Baby, baby, you give me a halo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I was far from cute before now I'm an angel (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So make room for me, I hope you don't let go (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I've been such a good boy, I hope you don't say no (meow)
now int give a fuck (na na na nanaaaaa !) now int give a fuck (na , na na , na na , na , na , naaaaaa ! )
(But) oh my God, what is this new emotion?
Now I'm such a puppy when you hold me
Feed me love, it's perfect and you know it
Follow you in circles and know that it's not a joke, babe
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'll walk over the obstacles and be there 'til the bitter end
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I just hope you understand (purr, purr, purr)
I don't wanna be just friends

It's no coincidence, it's a kitty-incidence

Girl, I promise (girl, I promise)
So get used to it (used to it), ain't no stopping
Me when you walk in

I was messin' (I was messin')
Now I'm thankin' ya
I learned my lesson (purr, purr)
I'm the one you can't keep your, keep your paws off (hey)
Go fetch when you say that I'm a dog walk (hey)
Fight for you in the biggest pack of wolves
They be racing, but I'm comin' in first, Impala
(Come to me) yeah, I like it when we cuddle
(Come to me) yeah, when you get yourself in trouble
I'm everything (shoo)
From the soft side to the tough stuff
'Til we cross the rainbow bridge, I'll be the one you always dream of
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Bet nobody else speaks the lil' language between you and me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I just hope you understand (purr, purr, purr)
I don't wanna be just friends

Let's play forever, I just wanna be your dog
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I just wanna be your dog
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Let's play forever, I just wanna be your dog
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I just wanna be your dog
